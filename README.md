ParabolicPDEs
=============

Finite differences project. MAPM312

All the different tasks that need completing for this project are listed
on the issues page (might have missed some). We'll assign everyone
different issues to work on and discuss related details on those
threads.

## Folder structure

`src` contains all MATLAB code and `txt` contains the text for the
written report. Any research papers you find should just be linked to in
the **Research links** section below.

## Research links

Some initial documents related to parabolic PDEs and coupled equations.

### Online

* [Coupled equations](http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/scripties/KorsuizeBachelor.pdf)
* [Has a section on parabolic PDEs](http://www.sml.ee.upatras.gr/UploadedFiles/BOOK-CK/06-PartialDifferentialEquations.pdf)

### Books

Links to books on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) may be a
good way to keep track of them.
